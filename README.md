 Hello! 
 I've implemented test task as requested at original readme.md file.
 Before running the *RunApp*, make sure *./data/* folder is in classpath before running.
 Use -d option at command line to switch off filtering.
 Use any IDE to open the project and run the app 'RunApp' as java app and
 run test classes as junit tests.
 Watch 'Selection*.png' files as an example of running tests and demo program
